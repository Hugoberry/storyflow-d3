# storyflow-d3

A partial implementation of the algorithm described in the paper [StoryFlow: Tracking the Evolution of Stories](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/yangliu/publication/storyflow.pdf) using [D3.js](http://d3js.org/). The [datasets](http://vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/~tanahashi/data_downloads/storyline_visualizations/story_data.tar) were taken from Yuzuru Tanahashi's [website](http://vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/~tanahashi/) and converted into JSON.

Developed as a project for the course [Information Visualization](http://www.jku.at/cg/content/e48361/e153097/e151851) in the summer semester 2015.

The live version is published at http://sorin-davidoi.github.io/storyflow-d3/.
